# optimizedb

Optimize database.

## Request JSON Syntax

| **Key** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| task | task name |
| token | token string encrypted. |
| dbname | database name |
| classname | database table name |
| async | default "no", if "yes" run the task in asynchronous mode |

* The status of a task running in asynchronous mode can be checked using the 'gettaskstatus' api
* Only one of these database tasks — addvoldb, backupdb, checkdb, compactdb, copydb, createdb, deletedb, loaddb, optimizedb, renamedb, restoredb, startdb, stopdb, unloaddb — can run against the same `dbname` at a time, whether or not `async` is used; a request is rejected immediately if another one of them is already running on that database
